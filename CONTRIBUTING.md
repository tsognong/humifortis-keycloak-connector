## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later
- Maven 3.8+
- Git
- Keycloak instance for testing

### Build and Test

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/keycloak-connector.git
cd keycloak-connector

# Build
mvn clean package

# Run tests
mvn test

# Install locally for testing
cp target/humifortis-keycloak-connector.jar /opt/keycloak/providers/
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test with multiple Keycloak versions (22.x, 23.x, 24.x)
- Verify integration with Humifortis SaaS
- Test error handling and edge cases

## Coding Standards

### Java Style

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep classes focused (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Use appropriate access modifiers
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Log at appropriate levels

### Example:

```java
public class GoodExample {
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(GoodExample.class);
    
    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        try {
            // Clear, focused logic
            validateEvent(event);
            sendToSaas(event);
            logger.debugf("Event processed: %s", event.getType());
        } catch (ValidationException e) {
            logger.warn("Invalid event", e);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("Failed to process event", e);
        }
    }
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reference issues when applicable

```
Add retry logic for SaaS communication

- Implement exponential backoff
- Add configurable retry count
- Log retry attempts

Fixes #123
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Thin Client Principle

The connector should remain a "thin client":
- ✅ Capture and send events
- ✅ Query and enforce decisions
- ❌ Don't add local risk calculation
- ❌ Don't add local policy logic
- ❌ Don't add caching of decisions

### API Communication

- Use async for event sending
- Keep timeouts configurable
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Log API errors appropriately

### Performance

- Minimize impact on authentication flow
- Use async operations where possible
- Avoid blocking calls
- Keep memory footprint small

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

```java
@Test
public void testEventMapping() {
    Event keycloakEvent = createTestEvent();
    HumifortisEvent result = mapper.fromKeycloakEvent(keycloakEvent);
    
    assertEquals("auth_login_failed", result.getEventType());
    assertNotNull(result.getEntityId());
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test with real Keycloak instance
- Verify SPI registration
- Test authentication flow
- Verify event sending

## Documentation
